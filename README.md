# resizeasaurus

A little utility to add resizing behavior to test intrinsically sized responsive components.

## [Demo](https://filamentgroup.github.io/resizeasaurus/demo.html)

## Usage

```
<resize-asaurus>
    My component goes here
</resize-asaurus>
```

Add the `disabled` attribute to disable the component behavior (and hide its styling).

```
<resize-asaurus disabled>
    My component goes here
</resize-asaurus>
```
